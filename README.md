## **To-Do List Web App**
A simple and elegant to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. Tasks are saved locally using the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

**Features:**
1. Add tasks with a simple click.
2. Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
3. Delete tasks by clicking on the delete button.
4. Tasks are saved locally and persist across sessions.
